Currently the partner builds for our reference devices are distributed via
services such as Google Drive and Box, however these are difficult to 
integrate into our automation. We should ask what we can do to improve
this. Ideally our partners will be able to upload the builds with the
confidence that they will not be accessible to anyone outside of groups
that have been cleared for access. This should include any machines that
may need to download the builds for automated flashing of devices, such as
our own Jenkins instances, or the partner selected for maintaining a farm
of reference devices.
