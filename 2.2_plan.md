# B2G | Automation | Test | Release (Sept -> Dec)

** Dates here are rough estimates from jlal need to sync up with team
first for a better estimate but this is the lits of _ongoing_ work.

Projects targeted for start of 2.2 (End of December)

### Taskcluster Gaia (full in tree configuration for gaia) [Oct]

  Push the power to configure tests to developers + open doors for
  later autoland work and intermittent detection.
  
  Initial work landed! Remaining bugs/tasks https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1076681

### Taskcluster Gecko/B2G (In tree configuration for phones, tests builds) [Nov]

  Much the same as taskcluster for gaia but effecting many more test
  suites and builds (such as emulators).
  
  Bug 1080265

### Profiling on the flames without gecko builds [Oct]

  Ability to profile taskcluster/buildbot generated builds for the
  flame out of the box without needing custom builds.
  
  Landed: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1061796 (one outstanding bug for third parties) 
  

### Better marionette/js integration for devices/emulators [Oct]

  Ability to run tests on the device/emulators/etc... from the
  marionette-js framework which will allow us to deprecate some then all
  of the python gaia-ui-tests.
  
  In progress: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1034504

  
### Taskcluster + Update server + tested updates [November]

  We do not run _any_ tests as part of the release process for the
  mar files which puts our dogfood(ing) users in a bad situation when
  we release updates that break devices... We need to both test the
  mar generation and apply them to an actual device and run our sanity
  suite.
  
  Bug: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1063701

### Autoland (Gaia only) [November]

  Follow on for Taskcluster gaia work to "autoland" commits in gaia
  (very similar to what bors does for rust/servo)
  
  Bug https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1080275 
  Inital POC done by kgrandon: https://github.com/KevinGrandon/autolander


### Faster b2g builds (on ci) [Dec]

  Right now we need 15 gig+ of dependencies just to build b2g which
  slows down iteration and makes it difficult for new contributors to get
  started. We can make this faster by caching targets per###android/chipset
  and use the cache when creating our incremental builds... This work also
  applies to local checkout so we can build a complete b2g image without
  rebuilding/downloading all of gonk if only gecko/gaia changes are
  needed.
  
  No metabug here yet still measuring to see what can actually be done to make sane:
  
  See: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1071281 (stats for our harnesses so we can optimize better)

### Device "cloud" for taskcluster [Nov-Dec]

  We are partnering with bitbar to manage our reference devices which
  will allow us to scale (to 100 initially) devices at will. This will
  allow us to do thing like "device try" and schedule on device tests in
  tree in a per-commit fashion.
  
  - Contracts done
  - Need metabug / discussion for how to integrate into TC

### Better Performance Testing

  https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1088108

  1. Remove reliance on atom scripts and eventing mechanisms, reduce reliance on marionette
  2. Switch to using performance markers from User Timing API
  3. Capture markers and measurements from across processes by parsing ADB logs
  4. Introduce dashboard visualization concept consuming performance data using Grafana and InfluxDB
  5. Allow performance tests to establish test target goals and performance "index" to establish a failure mechanism
  6. Allow performance tests to run on try-like infrastructure, enabling pre-commit failures and regression detection
  
### Gaia Desktop Tests OOP [Dec]

 - green up all in OOP testing and turn _off_ in process desktop tests.

### Gaia Monkey Testing

  Run monkey tests on Flame reference devices running debug builds using
  Orangutan and reporting crashes to Treeherder.

## Projects we are contributing to but do not own:

### B2G Desktop/Mulet RIL (Owned by Vicamo [vicamo is no longer with the project]) [??]

  Allow use of RIL features such as sms, telephony, etc.. from
  "Mulet" intended to help local development of RIL features +
  testing of RIL features so we do not need to rely on the emulators for
  all of our deep testing problmes.
