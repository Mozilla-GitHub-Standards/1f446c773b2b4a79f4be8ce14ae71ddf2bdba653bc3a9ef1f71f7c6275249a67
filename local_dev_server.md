Working from the command line is great, but sometimes you want to enhance your development environment with tools and resources that make common tasks easier and help visualize data from testing. Speaking from a performance perspective, having a UI that could run and visualize via graphs and aggregate the output from `make test-perf` would be handy, especially considering the current process involves manually parsing JSON. Having a local development server that could handle theses types of interactions would greatly enhance the development experience. This functionality could be exposed via the WebIDE and can accept and visualize data from tools like `make test-perf`.
